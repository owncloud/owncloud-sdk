Enhancement: Enforce `share_type` guest if applies

With oC10, the `share_type` is not set to guest, if a user shares a resource with a guest user,
therefore we check if the property `share_with_user_type` is present and set to `guest`,
if so we manipulate the `share_type` property and set it to guest.
