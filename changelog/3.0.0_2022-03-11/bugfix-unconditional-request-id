Bugfix: Always add X-Request-ID

We've removed a version check that omitted the `X-Request-ID` header value in request headers when the backend version was below v10.1.0. Since ownCloud Infinite Scale follows it's own versioning this caused oCIS not having the X-Request-ID in any request if below this version, hence preventing us from announcing the correct version for oCIS.
